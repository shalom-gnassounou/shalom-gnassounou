# 👋 Hello! I'm Shalom Gnassounou

🎓 I'm a web developer in training at M2i Formation in Lyon, currently transitioning from the world of sound engineering to  development.

💻 I'm learning and building projects with:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
- UX/UI basics: design, accessibility, wireframing
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Figma, Bootstrap, VS Code

🚀 My goal is to work in a collaborative, creative team where I can keep learning and bring meaningful digital projects to life.

🌟 Currently working on [Kpath](https://github.com/shalom-gnassounou/Kpath) — an interactive timeline exploring K-pop history.
